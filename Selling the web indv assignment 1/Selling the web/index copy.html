    <p>Katana are typically made from a special type of steel called tamahagane, which is produced from iron sand. The steel is heated and repeatedly folded to create a blade that is both strong and flexible. The final product is a work of art, with a distinctive hamon (temper line) that showcases the blade's unique characteristics.</p>
    <p>These swords were historically used by the samurai, the warrior class of feudal Japan, and are often associated with the bushido code of honor and discipline. The process of making a katana is highly specialized, involving multiple stages of forging, folding, and tempering the steel to create a blade that is both resilient and sharp.</p>
    <p> I have <strong>twenty six</strong> katanas personally. Blades of all <em>ages, lengths, and colors.</em> I have been collecting them since I was in highschool and have taken care of them as if they were my own children. Unfortunately i need to part ways with them so that i can pay my tuition for school so if there is anyone else that is passionate about swords please contact me so we can make some business! </p>
