    <h1>Music Record Information</h1>
    <p class="history">My record collection started in my basement in 1995, where I began collecting vinyl records of my favorite music. I then started my store 5 years later to share my love of music with others who share similar interests.</p>
    <p>Thats not to say albums are the only thing you can find in this establishment. You can also find posters, souvenirs, and other music-related items. Please come and share your love for music and others as well!</p>
    <p class="collection"> My record collection includes a variety of genres and artists so that anyone is more than welcome to come and explore.</p>
