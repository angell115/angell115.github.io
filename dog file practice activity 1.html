    <p> Do you have a dog? If so this is the perfect website for you! Dogs are a <em>cornerstone</em> in a lot of peoples homes that not only offer protection, but also a furry friend that will love you unconditionally. That is why it is important to keep yourself informed about their health as much as possible so that you can take care of them just as much as they take care of you!</p>
    <p>One big thing a lot of people are not that educated about when it comes to dogs is how they regulate heat and how to properly assist them when in hot weather. For starters, dogs do not sweat like we do, as a matter of fact, most of their heat regulation is controlled through their breathing. When dogs get really hot they tend to pant a lot to cool themselves down but since most dogs have fur, it can only do so much when they are under the sun. So for starters the best way to cool them down is to avoid direct heat from teh sun which can be done by taking shorter walks or getting breaks in a cool area or under some shade during walks. If that is not an option and a dog gets over heated, you would think to get some water a start pouring it on them bu thtat is <strong>NOT</strong> what should be done. This is because since dogs have fur, water isnt able ton do a proper job cooling them and instead traps heat making the situation worse. What you want to do is put water on their paws and belly as those are areas that have little to no fur and will actually help cool the dog down.</p>
